You are playing your favorite rhythm game, osu!mania. The layout of your beatmap consists of 𝑛 rows and 4 columns. Because notes at the bottom are closer, you will process the bottommost row first and the topmost row last. Each row will contain exactly one note, represented as a '#'.

For each note 1,2,…,𝑛, in the order of processing, output the column in which the note appears.

Input
The first line contains 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤100) — the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤500) — the number of rows of the beatmap.

The following 𝑛 lines contain 4 characters. The 𝑖-th line represents the 𝑖-th row of the beatmap from the top. It is guaranteed that the characters are either '.' or '#', and exactly one of the characters is '#'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed 500.

Output
For each test case, output 𝑛 integers on a new line, the column that the 𝑖-th note appears in for all 𝑖 from 1 to 𝑛.
